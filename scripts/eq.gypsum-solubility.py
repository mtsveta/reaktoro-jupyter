# # Gypsum solubility in water
#
# In this tutorial, we investigate the gypsum (CaSO<sup>4<\sup>) solubility in water. In the databases available in
# Reaktoro, CaSO<sup>4<\sup> is always referred to as anhydrite. When exposed to water, anhydrite transforms
# to the more commonly known/occurring form gypsum, (CaSO<sup>4<\sup> Â·2H<sup>2<\sup>O), by the absorption of water.
#
# Import necessary packages:

# Inside the function `solubility_of_gypsum()`, we also evaluate ph, ionic strength I, equilibrium constant lnK,
# adn saturation index SI. Since the SI > 0, the solution is supersaturated with gypsum.
# The obtained solubility in water is 2.308049 g/L (25 &deg;C), which is considerably higher than for calcite.
# Below, we use 172.17 g/mol as a molar mass of gypsum:

# We see again the solubility increase with decreasing temperature in CO2-saturated rainwater.
# Increasing pressure also increases the solubility of calcium carbonate.

# The plot illustrates that calcium carbonate has very low solubility in pure water, but in rainwater saturated with
# carbon dioxide, its solubility increases due to the formation of more soluble calcium bicarbonate. Calcium
# carbonate is unusual in that its solubility increases as the temperature of the water decreases.
