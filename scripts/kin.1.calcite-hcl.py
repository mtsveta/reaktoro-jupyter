# # Dissolution of calcite in an acidic HCl-solution
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how Reaktoro can be used for modeling the dissolution of calcite in an acidic
# HCl-solution at temperature 30 &deg;C and pressure 1 bar using chemical kinetics. A partial equilibrium
# assumption is considered here so that aqueous species react using a chemical equilibrium model, while calcite
# reacts with the aqueous solution using a chemical kinetics model.

# We start with again import the reaktoro Python package so that we can use its classes and methods for performing the
# chemical reaction calculations.

from reaktoro import *

# The class [ChemicalEditor](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html) is used to conveniently
# create instances of classes [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) and
# [ReactionSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ReactionSystem.html). In particular, we specify aqueous
# and mineral phases that should be considered in the chemical system. The aqueous phase is defined by the mixing of
# H2O, HCl, and CaCO3 (effectively, collecting all aqueous species in the database that contains elements H, O, C, Cl,
# and Ca, which are the elements in this list of compounds). There is only one pure mineral phase: the calcite phase.

editor = ChemicalEditor()
editor.addAqueousPhaseWithElementsOf("H2O HCl CaCO3")
editor.addMineralPhase("Calcite")

# We set the reaction equation using
# [setEquation](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalEditor.html#af3c6212c6edb42c0e6f110b493ece45c)
# method of the class [MineralReaction](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralReaction.html).
# Then, we add two mineral kinetic mechanisms for the reaction: neutral and acidic. This is done with the
# [addMechanism](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralReaction.html#a1bdeff51e51f42e4635208241cd54027)
# method, where we set, for example, `logk`, the kinetic rate constant of the reaction in log scale, and `Ea`, the
# Arrhenius activation energy. The values shown for `logk` and `Ea` were collected from:
#

# application to geochemical modeling. U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report (Vol. 2004â€“1068). Menlo Park,
# California.*
#
# Finally, we provide the specific surface area of the mineral using method
# [setSpecificSurfaceArea](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralReaction.html#a9ea2feb68af0beddc856d6a60b863181)
# of class [MineralReaction](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1MineralReaction.html), which can be specified
# in units of m<sup>2</sup>/g or m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>. Compatible units are allowed, such as cm<sup>2</sup>/mg or
# m<sup>2</sup>/dm<sup>3</sup>, and combinations.

# Create instances of [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) and
# [ReactionSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ReactionSystem.html).
# [ChemicalSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalSystem.html) is a class that represents a
# system and its attributes and properties, such as phases (in our case aqueous and mineral ones), species,
# elements (5 in total, i.e., H, O, Ca, C, Cl), formula matrix, as well as chemical and thermodynamical model. Class
# [ReactionSystem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ReactionSystem.html) serves as a system of the chemical
# reaction by a collection of [Reaction](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Reaction.html) class instances.
# It provides convenient methods that calculate the equilibrium constants, reaction quotients, and rates of the
# reactions.

system = ChemicalSystem(editor)
reactions = ReactionSystem(editor)

# ### Specifying the equilibrium and kinetic species
#
# For the partition of a chemical system into equilibrium and kinetic species, we use the class
# [Partition](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1Partition.html). We only
# need to specify which species are kinetic species, and all others will be equilibrium species by default.
# We set species Calcite (the only species in the mineral phase also called Calcite!) to be the only kinetic species.
# This will allow us to model the dissolution of calcite using chemical kinetics, while all other species (the
# aqueous species) are modeled using chemical equilibrium (i.e., their amounts are updated over time using chemical
# equilibrium calculations).

partition = Partition(system)
partition.setKineticSpecies(["Calcite"])


# ### Defining the initial state of the equilibrium species
#
# After constructing the chemical system and specifying the partitioning of the species, we proceed to a chemical
# equilibrium calculation to set the initial state of the equilibrium species. For this, we use class
# [EquilibriumProblem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumProblem.html), as shown below:

problem = EquilibriumProblem(system)
problem.setPartition(partition)
problem.setTemperature(30, "celsius")
problem.setPressure(1, "bar")
problem.add("H2O", 1, "kg")
problem.add("HCl", 1, "mmol")

# We specify the equilibrium/kinetic partitioning of the chemical system using the method
# [setPartition](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumProblem.html#a53a9496c9d4ffc72a85903146b390e44)
# of class [EquilibriumProblem](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1EquilibriumProblem.html). We then prescribe
# what should be the initial state of the equilibrium species (the aqueous species in this case), before we start the
# chemical kinetics calculation that will simulate the dissolution of calcite in this aqueous fluid.
#
# By mixing 1 kg of H<sub>2<\sub>O and 1 mmol of HCl at 30 &deg;C and 1 bar, we should produce a
# chemical equilibrium state that corresponds to an acidic aqueous fluid. The species in this fluid will be in
# disequilibrium with Calcite (our single kinetic species in this setup) since only equilibrium species
# (i.e., the aqueous species) are considered during the next chemical equilibrium calculation.

# ### Calculating the initial chemical equilibrium state of the fluid
#
# We now use the function equilibrate to calculate the chemical equilibrium state of the equilibrium partition,
# not the entire chemical system.

state0 = equilibrate(problem)
state0.output('demo-kineticpath-calcite-hcl-before-kinetics.txt')

# For this calculation, Reaktoro uses an efficient Gibbs energy minimization algorithm to determine the amounts of
# the equilibrium species that correspond to a state of minimum Gibbs energy in the equilibrium partition only,
# at given conditions of temperature, pressure, and element amounts in the equilibrium partition. The result is
# stored in the object state0 of class [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html), a computational representation of the state of a multiphase
# chemical system defined by its temperature (*T*), pressure (*P*), and vector of species amounts (*n*).

# To simulate the kinetic dissolution of calcite in the aqueous fluid we defined before, we need to specify its
# initial amount. Below, we set the initial mass of species Calcite to 100 g.

state0.setSpeciesMass("Calcite", 100, "g")

# ### Performing the kinetic path calculation
#
# To be able to simulate of the chemical kinetic path, we use class
# [KineticPath](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1KineticPath.html). Note that here again, we need to
# specify the partitioning of the chemical system into equilibrium, kinetic, and inert species.

path = KineticPath(reactions)
path.setPartition(partition)

# To analyse the result of kinetic simulations, we save the evolution of different properties of the chemical system
# into file `result.txt`:

output = path.output()
output.filename("results.txt")
output.add("time(units=minute)")
output.add("elementMolality(Ca units=mmolal)", "Ca [mmolal]")
output.add("phaseMass(Calcite units=g)", "Calcite [units=g]")
output.add("speciesMolality(Ca++ units=mmolal)", "Ca++ [mmol]")
output.add("speciesMolality(HCO3- units=mmolal)", "HCO3- [mmol]")
output.add("pH")

# **Note**: A list of all possible quantities that can be plotted is shown in the class
# [ChemicalQuantity](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalQuantity.html),
# which provides an interface for convenient ways of their retrieval.

# ### Solving the chemical kinetics problem
#
# Finally, we solve the kinetic path problem.
# This step executes the method solve of class
# [KineticPath](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1KineticPath.html), which requires the initial state of the
# system (100 g of calcite in disequilibrium with a 1 mmolal HCl aqueous solution at 30 &deg;C and 1 bar,
# represented with the object state0), the initial and final time of the kinetic path calculation (`t0` and `t1`,
# respectively), and the time unit of the specified time parameters (e.g., s, minute, day, year, etc.).

t0, t1 = 0.0, 5.0
path.solve(state0, t0, t1, "minute")

# Output the final state of the chemical system, we use the method
# [output](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html#ae5f2706f5be6e6856360a2f1073931e2) of class
# [ChemicalState](https://reaktoro.org/cpp/classReaktoro_1_1ChemicalState.html)

state0.output('demo-kineticpath-calcite-hcl-after-kinetics.txt')

# ### Plotting the results of equilibrium path calculation
#
# The best way to visually analyze the obtained reaction path is with plots. For that, we export python plotting
# package `matplotlib` and `numpy`, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# To load results from the outputfile, we use `loadtxt` function provided by the `numpy` package:

filearray = np.loadtxt("results.txt", skiprows=1)
data = filearray.T
time = data[0, :]
[ca_elem_indx, calcite_indx, ca_species_indx, hco3_indx, ph_indx] = np.arange(1, 6)

# The plots below depict different chemical properties (x-axis) with respect to the time interval of
# the kinetic simulation (y-axis):

plt.figure()
plt.plot(time, data[ca_elem_indx], label="Ca")
plt.xlabel("time")
plt.ylabel("Amount of Ca [mmolal]")
plt.legend(loc='center right')
plt.savefig("amount-ca-vs-time.png")

plt.figure()
plt.plot(time, data[calcite_indx], label="Calcite")
plt.xlabel("time")
plt.ylabel("Mass of Calcite [g]")
plt.legend(loc='center right')
plt.savefig("mass-calcite-vs-time.png")

plt.figure()
plt.plot(time, data[ph_indx], label="pH")
plt.xlabel("time")
plt.ylabel("ph")
plt.legend(loc='center right')
plt.savefig("ph-vs-time.png")

plt.figure()
plt.plot(time, data[ca_species_indx], label="Ca++")
plt.plot(time, data[hco3_indx], label="HCO3-")
plt.xlabel("time")
plt.ylabel("Molality [mmolal]")
plt.legend(loc='center right')
plt.savefig("molality-ca-hco3-vs-time.png")
