If you are using Reaktoro in demanding applications, you might want to manually specify the chemical species of each phase in your chemical system. This can be achieved by providing an explicit list of species names, e.g., `editor.addAqueousPhase(\"H2O(l) H+ OH- CO2(aq)\")`. Note, however, that care is required here to ensure relevant species are not missing. The just given example is a bad one in fact, with important species such as `HCO3-` and `CO3--` missing in the list!."
